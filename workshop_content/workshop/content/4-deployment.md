One way to deploy the application would be to have the images for the front-end and back-end microservice containers already created (via CI/CD) and stored in an image repository.  You can then create Kubernetes deployments (YAML) and use those to deploy the application.  We will do that now.

#### 1. Retrieve the login command

If you are doing the lab exercises from the terminal in the web browser, you can skip this step because the terminal has already been logged into OpenShift.

However, if you are running `oc` from your local machine, login via the CLI by:

- opening a tab to the OpenShift Console at: <https://console-openshift-console.%cluster_subdomain%>
- login using `%username%` as the username and `openshift` as the password if prompted
- click on the dropdown arrow next to your name in the top-right
- select *Copy Login Command*.

A new tab will open and select the authentication method you are using (in our case it's *github*)

Click *Display Token*

Copy the command under where it says "Log in with this token". Then go to your terminal and paste that command and press enter.  You will see a similar confirmation message if you successfully logged in.

```shell
$ oc login --token=RYhFlXXXXXXXXXXXX --server=https://api.osd4-demo.abc1.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
Logged into "https://api.osd4-demo.abc1.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443" as "0kashi" using the token provided.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

```

#### 2. Select project

A project called `%username%-ostoy` has been created for you. Select the project with the following command:

```execute
oc project %username%-ostoy
```

#### 3. Download the YAML configuration

Download the Kubernetes deployment object yamls

```execute
curl -o ~/ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/osdworkshop/master/OSD4/yaml/ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml
```

```execute
curl -o ~/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/osdworkshop/master/OSD4/yaml/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
```

Feel free to open them up and take a look at what we will be deploying.

```execute
cat ~/ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml
```

```execute
cat ~/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
```


For simplicity of this lab we have placed all the Kubernetes objects for the front-end in an "all-in-one" yaml file.  Though in reality there are benefits (ease of maintenance and less risk) to separating these out into individual yaml files.

#### 4. Deploy the backend microservice

The microservice serves internal web requests and returns a JSON object containing the current hostname and a randomly generated color string.

In your command line deploy the microservice using the following command:

```execute
oc apply -f ~/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
```

You should see the following response:
```shell
$ oc apply -f ~/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/ostoy-microservice created
service/ostoy-microservice-svc created
```

#### 5. Deploy the front-end service

The frontend deployment contains the node.js frontend for our application along with a few other Kubernetes objects to illustrate examples.

 If you open the *ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml* you will see we are defining:

- Persistent Volume Claim
- Deployment Object
- Service
- Route
- Configmaps
- Secrets

In your command line, deploy the frontend along with creating all objects mentioned above by entering:

```execute
oc apply -f ~/ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml
```

You should see all objects created successfully

```shell
$ oc apply -f ~/ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/ostoy-pvc created
deployment.apps/ostoy-frontend created
service/ostoy-frontend-svc created
route.route.openshift.io/ostoy-route created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-env created
secret/ostoy-secret-env created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-files created
secret/ostoy-secret created
```

#### 6. Get the route

Get the route so that we can access the application via

```execute
oc get route
```

You should see the following response:

```shell
NAME          HOST/PORT                                       PATH      SERVICES              PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
ostoy-route   ostoy-route-%username%-ostoy.apps.osd4-demo.abc1.p1.openshiftapps.com  ostoy-frontend-svc   <all>             None
```

#### 7. View the app

Click on this link to access the application: <http://ostoy-route-%username%-ostoy.%cluster_subdomain%>. You should see the homepage of our application. If you don't see the homepage of the application, you may need to wait a couple of minutes for the app to start.
